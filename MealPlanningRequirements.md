# Meal Planner Requirements

## User requirements for meal planning

This document outlines the requirements for the MealPlanner application, specifically focusing on the feature that allows users to create a meal plan for the week. The purpose of this document is to ensure clear understanding and alignment on the feature requirements among all stakeholders.

### Users want to easily plan meals for each day of the week.
Day-by-day meal planning helps users organize their cooking and shopping activities, ensuring they have all necessary ingredients and can manage their time effectively.

**Implications for Design:**
- **UI Layout:** A weekly calendar view or a list of days where users can click on a day to add meals.
- **Ease of Use:** Adding meals should be a straight forward process, with minimal clicks required.
- **Flexibility:** Users should be able to switch between days easily and see their entire week at a glance.

### Users prefer a simple and intuitive interface for adding and managing meals.
The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and intuitive navigation.

**Implications for Design:**
- **Minimalistic Design:** Keep the design clean and simple, avoiding unnecessary elements.
- **Guided Actions:** Provide tooltips, placeholder text, and prompts to guide users through the process.
- **Consistency:** Use consistent design patterns and UI elements throughout the app.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the interface is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Users want to save their meal plans and access them later.
Users should be able to save their meal plans and retrieve them in future sessions.

**Implications for Design:**
- **Persistence:** Implement a reliable data storage mechanism (e.g., local database, cloud storage) to save meal plans.
- **User Accounts:** Provide user authentication and accounts to enable users to save and access their plans across different devices.
- **Versioning:** Allow users to save multiple meal plans and differentiate between them (e.g., "Week 1 Plan", "Family Dinner Plan").
- **Quick Access:** Provide easy access to saved meal plans from the main interface.
- **Auto-Save:** Implement an auto-save feature to ensure meal plans are saved periodically.

### Users need the ability to customize meal plans, including adding, editing, and deleting meals.
Users should be able to customize their meal plans by adding new meals, editing existing meals, and deleting meals they no longer want.

**Implications for Design:**
- **Add Meals:** Provide a simple form or interface for users to add new meals, including meal name, ingredients, and any notes.
- **Edit Meals:** Allow users to modify the details of existing meals easily. Changes should be saved and reflected immediately.
- **Delete Meals:** Provide an easy and clear way to delete meals from the plan, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Ensure that all changes (add, edit, delete) are updated in real-time and persist between sessions.

### Users should be able to add multiple meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) for each day.
Users should have the option to add different meals for different times of the day (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).

**Implications for Design:**
- **Meal Categories:** Provide predefined categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) and allow users to add custom categories if needed.
- **UI Elements:** Ensure the interface supports multiple meals per day, perhaps through expandable sections or tabs for each meal type.
- **Input Flexibility:** Allow users to quickly switch between adding breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a given day.

### Users should be able to view, edit, and delete meals in their meal plan.
Users should be able to view their meal plan for the week, as well as edit or delete any meals.

**Implications for Design:**
- **View Meal Plan:** Provide a clear overview of the entire weekï¿½s meal plan, allowing users to see all planned meals at a glance.
- **Edit Meals:** Enable users to click on any meal to edit its details, with changes being saved immediately.
- **Delete Meals:** Allow users to remove meals with a simple delete action, ensuring there are confirmation steps to avoid accidental deletions.

*It's worth noting that the main requirements should be part of the mvp, and the implications for design are all very much "nice to haves" and may not all be implemented. I will however strive for a product that tries to achieve as many of these requirements as possible and where something can't be done either through tech limitiations (or simply lack of skill...) I'll try and justiy my decisions in the ticket.*
